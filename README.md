# In this project, I made a good looking craiglist clone.
## I used Django for the backend and html,css and materialize for the frontend.
## Also used another python librarys like Beautiful Soup and Requests for the web scrapping.
## The website was hosted on Heroku.
## Link to the website: https://project-craiglist-clone.herokuapp.com/
